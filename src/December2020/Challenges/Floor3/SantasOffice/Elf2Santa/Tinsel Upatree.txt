Howdy Santa! Just guarding the Naughty/Nice list on your desk.
Santa, I don't know if you've heard, but something is very, very wrong...
We tabulated the latest score of the Naughty/Nice Blockchain.
Our first thought was that he somehow changed the blockchain - but, as you know, that isn't possible.
We ran a validation of the blockchain and it all checks out.
Even the smallest change to any block should make it invalid.

Jack Frost is the nicest being in the world! Jack Frost!?!
As you know, we only really start checking the Naughty/Nice totals as we get closer to the holidays.
Out of nowhere, Jack Frost has this crazy score... positive 4,294,935,958 nice points!

Most of us recall Jack having a NEGATIVE score only a few days ago...
No one has EVER gotten a score that high! No one knows how it happened.
Worse still, his huge positive score seems to have happened way back in March.
Blockchains are huge, so we cut a one minute chunk from when Jack's big score registered back in March.
You can get a slice of the Naughty/Nice blockchain on your desk.
You can get some tools to help you here.
