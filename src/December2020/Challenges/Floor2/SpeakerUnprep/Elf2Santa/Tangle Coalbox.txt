Howdy Boss. You look a tad flushed.
Can I get you some water from the vending machine?
I'm still looking into the Snowball Game like you asked.
I read the write-up of the test completed earlier this summer with the web socket vulnerabilities.
I was able to complete the Easy level, but the Impossible level is, umm...
I'd call it impossible, but I just saw someone beat it!
Is it possible that the name a player provides influences how the forts are laid out?
Oh, oh, maybe if I feed a Hard name into an Easy game I can manipulate it!
UGH! on Impossible, the best I get are rejected player names in the page comments... maybe that's useful?

Wow, it really was all about abusing the pseudo-random sequence!
I've been thinking, do you think someone could try and cheat the Naughty/Nice Blockchain with this same technique?
I remember you told us about how if you have control over to bytes in a file, it's easy to create MD5 hash collisions.
But the nonce would have to be known ahead of time.
We know that the blockchain works by "chaining" blocks together.
There's no way you know who could change it without messing up the chain, right Santa?
I'm going to look closer to spot if any of the blocks have been changed.
