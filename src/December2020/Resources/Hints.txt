Sniffy
From: Alabaster Snowball
Objective: 9) ARP Shenanigans
Jack Frost must have gotten malware on our host at 10.6.6.35 because we can no longer access it. Try sniffing the eth0 interface using tcpdump -nni eth0 to see if you can view any traffic from that host.

Spoofy
From: Alabaster Snowball
Objective: 9) ARP Shenanigans
The host is performing an ARP request. Perhaps we could do a spoof to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack. I think we have some sample scapy traffic scripts that could help you in /home/guest/scripts.

Resolvy
From: Alabaster Snowball
Objective: 9) ARP Shenanigans
Hmmm, looks like the host does a DNS request after you successfully do an ARP spoof. Let's return a DNS response resolving the request to our IP.

Embedy
From: Alabaster Snowball
Objective: 9) ARP Shenanigans
The malware on the host does an HTTP request for a .deb package. Maybe we can get command line access by sending it a command in a customized .deb file
