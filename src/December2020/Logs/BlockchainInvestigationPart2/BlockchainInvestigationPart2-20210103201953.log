                Wow, it really was all about abusing the pseudo-random sequence!
                I've been thinking, do you think someone could try and cheat the Naughty/Nice Blockchain with this same technique?

                I remember you told us about how if you have control over to bytes in a file, it's easy to create MD5 hash collisions.

                But the nonce would have to be known ahead of time.
                We know that the blockchain works by "chaining" blocks together.
                There's no way you know who could change it without messing up the chain, right Santa?
                I'm going to look closer to spot if any of the blocks have been changed.
