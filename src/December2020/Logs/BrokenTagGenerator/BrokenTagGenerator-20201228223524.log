                Hi Santa!
                If you have a chance, I'd love to get your feedback on the Tag Generator updates!
                I'm a little concerned about the file upload feature, but Noel thinks it will be fine.

                Sorry to be a pest Santa, but could you look at the Tag Generator?
                I've been looking at it, and I wonder if the source code would provide more insight?
                I told Noel we should be more careful about disclosing information in error messages.

                I tried what you suggested and enumerating all endpoints really is good idea to understand an application's functionality.
                Sometimes though, I find the Content-Type header hinders the browser more than it helps.
                Blind command injection can be frustrating though. Do you think output redirection would help?

                If you find a way to execute code blindly, I bet you can redirect to a file then download that file!

                We might be able to find the problem if we can get source code!

                Once you know the path to the file, we need a way to download it!

                Can you figure out the path to the script? It's probably on error pages!

                If you're having trouble seeing the code, watch out for the Content-Type! Your browser might be trying to help (badly)!

                Is there an endpoint that will print arbitrary files?

                I'm sure there's a vulnerability in the source somewhere... surely Jack wouldn't leave their mark?

                Remember, the processing happens in the background so you might need to wait a bit after exploiting but before grabbing the output!
